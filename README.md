# yarfs
Yet Another Remote File Service.
Project for the [Network and Computer Security](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/SIRS1795/2017-2018/1-semestre/objectivos) course at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST)](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) Alameda 2017/2018.

## HTTPS

### Server
To enable HTTPS on the yarfs server, a valid certificate is needed.
If you want to create one yourself, use the included script (ca/generate.sh) to generate these certificates:
 1. root CA certificate
 2. CA certificate signed by the root CA
 3. server certificate signed by the CA

The root CA certificate can then be imported into your favourite browser for testing.

Here's how. Navigate to the ca folder:
`cd ca`
Then:
 1. generate the root CA certificate:
 `bash generate.sh root`

 2. generate the CA certificate signed by the root CA:
 `bash generate.sh ca`

 3. generate the server certificate signed by the CA:
 `bash generate.sh server`

When this is done, import the root CA (yarfs-root.pem) into your favourite browser and copy the yarfs-server.jks
keystore to the server directory. You should now be able to test HTTPS support on the server using your browser.

Note that the script assumes the root CA, CA and server use the domain names root.yarfs, ca.yarfs and server.yarfs,
respectively. You should either change or register them on you local hosts file.

### Client
To enable HTTPS on the yarfs client, simply run it using https:// in the base URL argument (use --help).
If using a local root CA (e.g. yarfs-root.pem), you must add it to the local list of trusted CAs.
Once again, navigate to the ca folder, `cd ca`, then:

 1. Convert the yarfs-root CA certificate to DER format:
 ` bash generate.sh root-to-der`

 2. Verify the root CA information. *Make sure it is correct*:
 `keytool -v -printcert -file yarfs-root.der`

 3. Find out where the keystore for the trusted CAs is located in your system. It is probably located in the following file, owned by root. If not, find it with `find / -name cacert`, and then export the CACERTS variable to point to the cacerts file:
 `export CACERTS=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`

 4. Create a backup of the trusted CA certificates keystore:
 `cp -v $CACERTS ~/$(basename $CACERTS).bak`

 5. As root, add our local root CA to the truted certificates keystore. The default password is _changeit_:
 `keytool -importcert -alias yarfs-root -keystore $CACERTS -file yarfs-root.der`

The client should now be able to use HTTPS. Test it using
 `cd client; mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.args="https://server.yarfs:31000"`

When you are done, restore the trusted certificates keystore ;) :
 `cp -v ~/$(basename $CACERTS).bak $CACERTS`


## HOW TO RUN
These are the instructions on how to test the project by running everything on
the same machine.
To use differente machine for the server, CA and client(s), the addresses need
to be changed and the certificates and keys need to be properly distributed.

1. First of all, this project uses the /var/yarfs directory to store all its files,
   so whenever a user wants to upload/download files to/from the server, that's where
   will look for or place them into. Create the necessary folder structure:
   ```
	sudo mkdir -p /var/yarfs/server/files
	sudo mkdir -p /var/yarfs/client/files
	sudo mkdir -p /var/yarfs/client/.keys
	sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/yarfs
	```

2. Generate Certificates and Key Stores with our script, following the instructions in the HTTPS section above. Use password="password".

3. For these certificates to be valid, register *server.yarfs* and *ca.yarfs* in your /etc/hosts file (pointing to the desired IP address - to run locally, 127.0.0.1 will do).

4. Add the Root CA certificate to your local Java list of trusted CAs as described in the README.md file (section HTTPS/Client).

5. Link/Copy the Server's Key Store to the server module's root directory (YARFSROOT is the folder the README.md file is located):
	```
	cd $YARFSROOT/server/
	ln -fs ../root-ca/yarfs-server.jks
	```

6. You can now run the server:
	```
	mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.args="31000 --ssl --listen=server.yarfs"
	```

7. On another shell, link/copy the CA's Key Store to the CA module's root directory:
	```
	cd $YARFSROOT/ca/
	ln -fs ../root-ca/yarfs-ca.jks yarfs-ca.jks
	```

8. You can now run the CA:
	```
	mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.args="https://server.yarfs:31000 --port=31001 --listen=ca.yarfs"
	```

9. On another shell, Link/Copy the CA's certificate into the client module's root directory:
	```
	cd $YARFSROOT/ca/
	ln -s ../root-ca/yarfs-ca.pem yarfs-ca.pem
	```

10. Finally, to run the client, you can use the *runclient.sh* script we included,
    as this module depends on the CA module and the compilation process is troublesome:
    ```
    bash runclient.sh
    ```

### Example usage
Now that all three components of the application are running, you can try running
some commands in the client's shell.

0. Check the commands that are available in the client's shell use the help command.
The "yarfs $" is the prompt text which appears when the client shell is ready to
receive commands from the user:
	`yarfs $ help`
